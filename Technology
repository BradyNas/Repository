I love technology because of how it is useful for so many purposes. People from all different sorts of jobs can get information pertaining to their job online and shop for things that they need like car parts or kitchen equipment. People can use their smart phones as as a tool to keep track of stuff like meetings, Email, plans with friends, banking, their own businesses and so on. They rate at which people use technology is only going to keep growing and growing and I would like to be a part of it.
